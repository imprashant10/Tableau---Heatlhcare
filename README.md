This repository contains a Tableau dashboard for healthcare data analysis. The dataset used for this analysis includes information about total costs, average length of stay, demographic analysis, clinical insights, severity by mortality, mortality by gender, hospital performance, and common diagnosis analysis. The data was processed and cleaned using Python and its libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. The cleaned data was then analyzed using Tableau to create insightful visualizations on healthcare metrics.

Process:

Data Processing and Cleaning: The dataset was initially in a raw and unstructured format consisting of various types of data fields. We used Python and its libraries to clean and preprocess the data. The following steps were involved in the data cleaning process:
Removal of duplicates and missing values.
Handling of outliers and anomalies.
Data normalization and transformation.
Feature engineering and selection.
Data formatting and exporting to a CSV file.
Creating Visualizations using Tableau: The processed data was imported into Tableau to create visualizations that can easily be interpreted and understood. We used various types of charts and plots to present different aspects of the data, including bar charts, line charts, and heat maps. The following are the main visualizations created:
Total Costs vs. Average Length of Stay
Demographic Analysis
Clinical Insights and Severity by Mortality
Mortality by Gender and Hospital Performance
Common Diagnosis Analysis
Insights and Suggestions:
The data indicates a strong correlation between total costs and the average length of stay, suggesting that there is a need to focus on reducing the average length of stay for patients to reduce costs.
The demographic analysis reveals a significant difference in healthcare metrics for different age groups.
The clinical insights and severity by mortality analysis highlight the importance of considering severity when analyzing healthcare data.
The mortality by gender analysis indicates that there is a significant difference in mortality between men and women for different healthcare conditions.
The hospital performance analysis can help identify underperforming hospitals and address areas for improvement.
Suggestions for Improving the Dashboard:
Adding more data sources and visualizations to provide more context and insights.
Implementing interactive features, such as filters, to enable users to explore the data and find insights.
Incorporating statistical analysis to further investigate the relationships between different variables.
Including data stories or visualizations to provide a more engaging and interactive experience.
Adding more context and explanations to help users understand the data and its implications.
